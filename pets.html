	<h1>My Fur Babies</h1>
	
	
	<P>I like to take pictures sometimes, mostly of my pets.</p>
	
	<IMG SRC="Zeus.png">
	<P>This is Zeus. He is my first piggy. He loves carrots and cuddling.</p>
	
	<IMG SRC="Hades.jpeg">
	<P>This is Hades. He does not like people very much and is very anti-social, but I love him anyway.</p>
	
	<IMG SRC="dante.jpeg">
	<P>This is Dante. He is a five year old Degu, which is kind of like a smaller version of a Chinchilla.</p>
	<P>He's probably the coolest rodent I've ever seen.</p>
	
	
	<IMG SRC="Luci.jpeg">
	<P>This is Luci. She's a rescue kitty from the <A HREF="http://bangorhumane.org">Bangor Humane Society</A>. She's a princess.</p>
	
	<IMG SRC="Riley1.jpeg"><IMG SRC="Riley2.jpeg">
	<P>This is Riley. He is a 7 year old Goldendoodle and the kindest, cuddliest dog you could ever meet.</p>
